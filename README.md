# MicrobubblesPython

This is source code for some of the microbubble motion tracking software I developed at Sunnybrook Hospital S-Wing Hurvitz Brain Research Centre in 2019. 

- Developed motion tracking and signal processing software in Python and MATLAB to analyze neurobiological
experimental data, from ultrasound recordings to local field potentials in the rat brain.
- Increased experimental acquisition efficiency by 50% through the development of a particle tracking velocimetry code
that automated vessel velocity recordings in the brain which drastically reduced data analysis time.
